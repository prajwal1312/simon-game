# Game Description
This is a popular memory game where players must remember which order the lights were activated and replicate it. Any of the red, blue, yellow or green lights can be lit in any order including the same light being activated multiple times consecutively.
# How to Play
When the game begins a button is lit and a tone sounds. Players must click that same light. After a single incorrect answer the game is over. For each additional round an additional light is added to the sequence. The score at the bottom of the screen shows how many rounds you have completed correctly, which is one less than the number of lights in the sequence of the current round of an active game.
